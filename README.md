Working on rev2 and decided to have versioning for board so layouts are not complete yet. rev1 in schematics folder should be working as is.

rev1 allows for bluetooth via adafruit breakout board but firmware is not coded for it and may never be since it works weird with TMK (I've done it before it's not elegant)

TODO:
* Add STEP files for 3d printing/designing
* board rev2 without bluetooth and more compact size
* PDF files of schematics
* Better docs
* images
* how to build one?
